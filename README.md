I am from Uttarakhand, INDIA, here we have world famous Jim Corbett National Park .
## Summary 
In these type of Forest the Animals identifier is an idea  for an app or program for identification of a photograph taken by the user to identify the Animal species.
The program or app should be user-friendly and easy to use. For Animal watching 
beginners who has no expensive or high quality binocular, this app or program shoul mke it easier for the user 
to idenfity the Animal species and some general facts about the species.
**Background**
As a Animal watcher for a few years with limited equipment, such as high quality binoculars and apps. 
Have problems to identify Animal that are within eyesight reach due to many Animal species can look quiet similar. 
There is different apps that have the animal species different sounds that is great but not good enough for a beginner
 to be certain of an animal species. Is makes is more fun to explore nature and to check off all the animal species you have seen.

**How** is it used?
The user can be anyone intrested in animal at any level. Itcan be used anywhere where user can find an intresting animal to idenfity.

The solutions are:

Photograh - a picture taken and a machine learning method that can use some kind of neural network method with a large 
data training set of all animal species. This makes the progam able to give an output of the most similar animal species compared 
with the photograh and the other parameters above.
location time (animal have a routine which is a useful variabel for us to use for identification of animal species. 
The species are the most active at different hour of the day)
Data sources and AI methods
The data scoure of location, animal species habitat and visits can be used from the websites . 
Many animal watchers use these website to report their finds. Information they put in can be pictures, location, distance, 
type of activity, animal species, the time they saw the species and so on.

**Challenges**
What my project dont solve is the frequency of the same animal being at different location 


What next?
More pthyon script that solves these problems to give out a accurrate output. The users data collection will also increase
 the machine learning.
